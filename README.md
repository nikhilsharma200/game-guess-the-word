# Guess The Word Game

This is a simple text-based Java program that allows you to play the "Guess The Word" game. In this game, you'll be presented with a secret word, and you have a limited number of attempts to guess the word by providing letters. The program will provide feedback on whether your guessed letters are correct and display the progress of the word as you guess.

## How to Play

1. The program selects a random word from a predefined list of words.
2. You have a maximum number of attempts (6 by default) to guess the word.
3. After each guess, the program will provide feedback:
   - If your guess is correct, it will reveal the correct letter's position in the word.
   - If your guess is incorrect, it will inform you and decrease your remaining attempts.
4. Continue guessing letters until you either:
   - Correctly guess the entire word, in which case you win the game.
   - Run out of attempts, in which case you lose the game.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your computer.
2. Compile the Java file: `javac GuessTheWordWithArrayList.java`
3. Run the program: `java GuessTheWordWithArrayList`

Enjoy playing the game and challenging yourself to guess the words!
